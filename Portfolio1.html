	<h2>Main Text Title</h2>
		<h3>Sub-heading 1</h3>
			<h4>18th of January 2021</h4>
				<p> Dialogues between a Doctor of Divinity and a Student in the Laws of England is a legal treatise by Christopher St. Germain, first published in the early 16th century. As its name suggests, the work is structured as a set of dialogues between the eponymous doctor, a doctor of divinity; and a student of the English common law.</p>
	
		<h3>Sub-heading 2</h3>
			<h4>19th of January 2021</h4>
				<p> Doctor and Student explores the relationship between the common law and equity and distinguishes a number of sources of legal principles. It was an important text for English law students at least until William Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England was published in the mid-18th century.</p>
